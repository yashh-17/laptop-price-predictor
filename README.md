# Laptop Price Predictor

This project aims to predict laptop prices using various machine learning regression models. By analyzing key features such as screen size, RAM, CPU, and other specifications, the goal is to accurately estimate the price of a laptop.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numeric features.
- **Multiple Regression Models:** Implemented Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and other models to predict laptop prices.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualized data distributions, feature importance, and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, R2 Score, and accuracy.
